# Fundraising Analysis
## Overview of Project
overview of the project is a challenge, an exercise of Excel prowess by creating two new analyses: outcomes based on goals and products based on launch date. Louise is an upcoming playwriter who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever" for which she is estimating a budget of $10,000. She wants our help to determine whether there are specific factors that make project campaigns successful. We will be analyzing and sorting crowdfunding data to determine the same.

### Purpose
the purpose was for Louise’s play Fever to come close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared about their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. We need to provide visualized feedback to Louise with insights to help her gain a better understanding of the campaign from start to finish so that she will be able to set her campaign to mirror other successful ones in the same category.

## Analysis and Challenges
 we figured it had to be sorted and prepared for the analysis by creating a new column to show Percentage funded, Average Donation, split categories and subcategories, convert dates, and also creating a new column for the year of the Launched date.
![This was  based on the Outcomes of the Parent Category.](resources/Analysis and Challenges.png)
The below chart is based on the Outcomes of the Parent Category. This chart shows that Theater was the most successful overall.

The below chart is based on the Subcategory Outcomes. And it helps us to conclude that the subcategory "Plays" is the most successful of all. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Launch Date](resources/OutcomesTheaterLaunchDate.png)
The char most successful campaigns are organized in May and June had a relatively high number of Successful theater campaigns and December had the least. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcomes Based on Goals](resources/OutcomesBasedGoals.png)
The below Line chart helps us to understand that Goals less than $1000 were 76% successful and most of the unsuccessful campaigns were around $45000 - $49999. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
![date conversion](resources/trend.png)
Firstly, the dataset had to be sorted and organized to start the basic analysis.
Had to further refine the searches using filters and updating the chart to view certain results.
Experimented with the Pivot table and Charts and faced some formula errors which I had to learn and rectify.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on the Launch Date?
Launching the campaign at the right time is important for it to be successful.
The length of the campaign can also be important to analyze.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Outcome goals focus on the endpoint of success and failure As per the data gathered we can conclude that Louise's goal had a 54% chance of it being successful.
Having a considerably high goal can also affect the campaign.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Information on the Genre of plays would have helped determine the success of plays and give better analysis to Louise.
The US and UK are the countries where most of the plays were successful. If we had more information about the cities and the age group of people going and watching the play would have been interesting to see.
The dataset is from the year range - 2009 to 2017. If we had information about current data. We could have analyzed current trends.
- What other possible tables and/or graphs could we create?
A clustered column chart can be used to show the outcomes based on the launch date.
A stacked column A clustered column chart can be used to show Outcomes based on goals.
